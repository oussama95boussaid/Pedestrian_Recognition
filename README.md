# PedestrianGuard
The primary goal of this project is to classify images swiftly and accurately, determining whether they contain pedestrians or not
**Key Features:**
**HOG Feature Descriptor:** PedestrianGuard AI utilizes Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) as a powerful feature descriptor. HOG captures the local intensity gradients of an image, allowing for robust detection of pedestrian shapes and structures.

**SVM Classification:** The project employs Support Vector Machines (SVM) as the classification algorithm. SVM excels at distinguishing between pedestrian and non-pedestrian images, creating a reliable model for real-time decision-making.
